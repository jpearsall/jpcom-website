## Introduction

The year was 1999 and the new millennium, full of promises and bluster, was 
quickly approaching. I was offered a most generous choice for my graduation. 
The choice of graduation gift was a car or a computer. Much to my family's 
chagrin, I chose the computer. Thus began a great ocean of time spent on IRC, 
Usenet, online games - specifically MUDs and Ultima Online, and the young 
"world-wide web" just entering a clumsy adolescence. Our journey would be 
taken together. Here is but a humble homage to those halcyon days.

## The Hardware

| Component      | Description                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| CPU            | Pentium III 450MHz                  |
| Memory         | 64MB                                |
| Storage        | 10GB                                |
| 2D/3D Graphics | Voodoo 3 3000 AGP w/ 64MB video RAM |
| Audio          | Creative Sound Blaster 16           |
| Communications | 56K modem                           |

## Does it Boot?

After taking a moment to check the nearly 25 year-old capacitors, the moment 
of truth has arrived. I press the power button feeling the *smoosh* of 
nostalgia. I am welcomed by the BIOS splash screen and the memory test. Alas, 
the familiar light blue screen with a boisterous "Windows 98" boot screen. A 
good start! The rapid staccato of chucka-chucka-chucka as the hard drive head 
sweeps across a magnetized platter. A most welcome chime resounds splendidly 
over my thrifted speakers. We have boot!

## Game On!

I hit the realization that I cannot engage in a time-honored tradition. There 
is a game that has been ported to everything from toasters to refridgerators, 
that would be id Software's brilliant contribution aptly named DOOM. However, 
I did have my venerable copies of Quake and Duke Nukem 3D. I press the CD-ROM 
eject button with much aplomb. *Rrr rrr chonk*. Well that didn't go splendidly.
I dig through my trove of thrifted goods and find a 52x drive and install it.
Hoo boy, FPSes sure have evolved since then. After fumbling around and dying 
horribly with a huge grin on my face I decide to move onto the next step. That 
being getting this thing online!

## Nostalgia Online?

I grab the wifi modem that I use with my Apple *II*e and attach it to the rat 
nest of serial cables, serial gender changers, and adapters. I try to dust off 
the dusty corner of my brain that holds DB9/DB25 pinouts and the nuances of 
DCE/DTE connections. After a couple of hours I'm no closer to success. I'm a 
bit too engaged to want to break out the oscilloscope so I wait a couple days 
for a compatible PCI wifi card to arrive. There is no native support for wifi 
in Windows 98 Second Edition so I have to use the native software. This means, 
for sake of convenience, using an insecure network. I do this over my phone as 
I live in a secluded area and it is for a brief period of time. Sorry fellow 
infosec engineers! It works! I immediately dial into the 
[Level 29](https://bbs.fozztexx.com/) and [20ForBeers](http://20forbeers.com:1339/)
BBS. I lose the rest of the evening to catching up on messages and sneaking 
time into Legend of the Red Dragon and TradeWars 2002.

## Conclusion

While I didn't meet all my goals, I've definitely found room for improvement.
I already have a list of hardware upgrades and haven't given up hope on the 
task of dial-up networking. Worst case, I'll dust off my RpISP and my phone 
line simulator and get it going via dial-up. My nostalgia itch has been 
scratched and I have a new toy to play with for my retro Fridays here-to now 
referred to as fRetro Friday.
